# Abacus -
##### A document generation tool to bridge the gap between your notes and LaTeX
Find our live site at: https://abacus-teamdat.firebaseapp.com

### Why?
We discovered, for many users, picking up LaTeX with no knowledge
is often difficult. This difficulty is caused by the 
large number of packages built on the LaTeX platform, as well
as the general syntax the user must learn to be able to successfully
create a renderable document. 

### Functions:
* Convert images to LaTeX (`.tex`) documents
* Provide rendered downloads of LaTeX code in `.pdf` format
* Provide intuitive modification of document within the users browser
